## Overview

**PT 2 ENGINE** enables the conversion of `.pt` files into `.engine` files, which is useful for:
- Game development, where `.pt` files might store proprietary data, and `.engine` files are needed to load that data into custom game engines.
- Modding communities, where converting these files may unlock new functionalities or integration with other tools.
- Any workflow where seamless file format conversions between `.pt` and `.engine` are crucial.

## Features

- **Fast Conversion:** PT 2 ENGINE is optimized for speed, ensuring that your `.pt` to `.engine` conversions happen in a flash.
- **Batch Processing:** Convert multiple `.pt` files into `.engine` files at once, saving time and increasing efficiency.
- **Error Handling:** PT 2 ENGINE checks for common errors in the `.pt` file and provides detailed error messages if the conversion fails, helping you troubleshoot.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it versatile for various development environments.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal system resource usage, ensuring that your machine runs smoothly even while performing large batch conversions.
- **Easy Integration:** PT 2 ENGINE can be easily integrated into existing pipelines, with the option to run as a command-line tool or even in an automated script.

## How It Works

PT 2 ENGINE works by reading the structure and content of a `.pt` file, which is a proprietary format used for storing specific data (such as game assets, configuration data, or encoded information). The program parses the `.pt` file, extracts the data, and then re-encodes it into the `.engine` format, which can be read and utilized by custom game engines or other software that requires `.engine` files.

### The Conversion Process:
1. **Input Validation:** PT 2 ENGINE first checks if the input `.pt` file adheres to the expected structure. It ensures there are no corrupt data or unexpected configurations.
2. **Parsing:** The program reads and parses the `.pt` file, understanding the data format and converting it into a structured internal representation.
3. **Re-Encoding:** This internal representation is then re-encoded into a valid `.engine` file that can be directly used by the target system.
4. **Output:** The resulting `.engine` file is saved to the designated output directory or can be set to automatically overwrite the original file.

### Supported File Types:
- **.pt:** The proprietary input file format.
- **.engine:** The output file format that PT 2 ENGINE generates.
